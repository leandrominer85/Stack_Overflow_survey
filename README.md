# Project Stack Overflow 2020 Survey

## This project is part of the UDACITY Nanodegree Data Science Course. 

The aim is to analyse the data of the Stack Overflow 2020 survey (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) to respond the answer the question: What are the differences between the group of coders that lives in the developed countries and the ones that live in the undeveloped ones.

For this purpose I'm considering that the developed countries are the ones classifield as with very high developed by the UN (http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi).

This is a exploratory project, so I'm not using any inferential statistics.

Two things should be consider in the analysis. The number of respondents differ, as one shoud expect, with more coders living in the developed countries. Also the use of a currency with high value in the market (US$) as a parameter for the salary makes that the salary in the undeveloped countries is much lower.
